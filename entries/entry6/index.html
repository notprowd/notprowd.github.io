        I could make you mad <br>
        I could make you scream <br>
        I could make you cry <br>
        I could make you leave <br>
        I could make you hate me for everything <br>
        But I can't make you come back to me <br>
        But I can't make you come back to me <br>
        Called me all day, but I never pick up <br>
        Instead of pulling my weight, always pushing my luck <br>
        You gave me all that I could take, <br>
        Head up in the clouds, yeah, I never understand it <br>
        I remember thinking, I don't need you <br>
        But then time passed by and it's so untrue <br>
        Now I'm the rain over your parade, <br>
        Yeah, I always keep making the same mistakes <br>
        Maybe I never deserved you anyway <br>
        I could make you mad <br>
        I could make you scream<br>

        I could make you say things you don't mean<br>
        I can unmake all we were made to be<br>
        But I can't make you come back to me<br>
        But I can't make you come back to me<br>
        Calling all day, tryna make things right<br>
        Just to fuck it all up when I see you tonight<br>
        Since you told me, "Hit the road"<br>
        I've been running on empty<br>
        If anything I know, it's how to ruin a happy ending<br>
        And I remember when you still needed me<br>
        Don't know how I let it go so easily<br>
        Now I'm the cloud to your sunny days<br>
        Don't know how I keep making the same mistakes<br>
        Maybe I never deserved you anyway<br>
        I could make you mad<br>
        I could make you scream<br>
