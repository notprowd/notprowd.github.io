    <p>I sit and watch you reading with your<br>
      Head low<br>
      I wake and watch you breathing with your<br>
      Eyes closed<br>
      I sit and watch you<br>
      And notice everything you do or don't do<br>
      You're so much older and wiser and I<br>
      <br>
      I wait by the door like I'm just a kid<br>
      Use my best colors for your portrait<br>
      Lay the table with the fancy shit<br>
      And watch you tolerate it<br>
      If it's all in my head tell me now<br>
      Tell me I've got it wrong somehow<br>
      I know my love should be celebrated<br>
      But you tolerate it<br>
      <br>
      I greet you with a battle hero's welcome<br>
      I take your indiscretions all in good fun<br>
      I sit and listen<br>
      I polish plates until they gleam and glisten<br>
      You're so much older and wiser and I<br>
      <br>
      I wait by the door like I'm just a kid<br>
      Use my best colors for your portrait<br>
      Lay the table with the fancy shit<br>
      And watch you tolerate it<br>
      If it's all in my head tell me now<br>
      Tell me I've got it wrong somehow<br>
      I know my love should be celebrated<br>
      But you tolerate it<br>
      <br>
      While you were out building other worlds, where was I?<br>
      Where's that man who'd throw blankets over my barbed wire?<br>
      I made you my temple, my mural, my sky<br>
      Now I'm begging for footnotes in the story of your life<br>
      Drawing hearts in the byline<br>
      Always taking up too much space or time<br>
      You assume I'm fine<br>
      But what would you do if I, I<br>
      <br>
      Break free and leave us in ruins<br>
      Took this dagger in me and removed it<br>
      Gain the weight of you then lose it<br>
      Believe me, I could do it<br>
      If it's all in my head tell me now<br>
      Tell me I've got it wrong somehow<br>
      I know my love should be celebrated<br>
      But you tolerate it<br>
      <br>
      I sit and watch you<br>

  <p>Gray November<br>
    I've been down since July<br>
    Motion capture<br>
    Put me in a bad light<br>
    I replay my footsteps on each stepping stone<br>
    Trying to find the one where I went wrong<br>
    Writing letters<br>
    Addressed to the fire<br>
    And I was catching my breath<br>
    Staring out an open window<br>
    Catching my death<br>
    And I couldn't be sure<br>
    I had a feeling so peculiar<br>
    That this pain would be for<br>
    Evermore<br>
    Hey December<br>
    Guess I'm feeling unmoored<br>
    Can't remember<br>
    What I used to fight for<br>
    I rewind the tape but all it does is pause<br>
    On the very moment all was lost<br>
    Sending signals<br>
    To be double crossed<br>
    And I was catching my breath<br>
    Barefoot in the wildest winter<br>
    Catching my death<br>
    And I couldn't be sure<br>
    I had a feeling so peculiar<br>
    That this pain would be for<br>
    Evermore<br>
    Can't not think of all the cost<br>
    And the things that will be lost<br>
    Oh, can we just get a pause?<br>
    To be certain we'll be tall again<br>
    Whether weather be the frost<br>
    Or the violence of the dog days<br>
    I'm on waves, out being tossed<br>
    Is there a line that I could just go cross?<br>
    And when I was shipwrecked (can't think of all the cost)<br>
    I thought of you (all the things that will be lost now)<br>
    In the cracks of light (can we just get a pause?)<br>
    I dreamed of you (to be certain we'll be tall again)<br>
    (If you think of all the costs)<br>
    It was real enough (whether weather be the frost)<br>
    To get me through (or the violence of the dog days)<br>
    (Out on waves being tossed)<br>
    But I swear (is there a line that we could just go cross?)<br>
    You were there<br>
    And I was catching my breath<br>
    Floors of a cabin creaking under my step<br>
    And I couldn't be sure<br>
    I had a feeling so peculiar<br>
    This pain wouldn't be for<br>
    Evermore<br>
    Evermore (evermore)<br>
    Evermore<br>
    This pain wouldn't be for evermore (evermore)<br>
    Evermore<br>

    <div class="box-parasite">
      <p>
        If you live in the New York City region, you probably<br>
        heard news reports of a “flesh-eating bacteria” that<br>
         has sickened several people. The disease is caused by <br>
         an infection from a bacteria called Vibrio vulnificus,<br>
          which can cause severe wound infections and, sometimes,<br>
           blood stream infections, sepsis, and even death.<br>
        While worrisome, Vibrio vulnificus is extremely rare.<br>
         Every year, there are about 100 cases reported in the <br>
         United States. Vibrio vulnificus is less concerning for<br>
          the general population, but is a major risk if you have<br>
           a weakened immune system.<br>
        Vibrio vulnificus tends to grow in brackish water, <br>
        which is a mixture of saltwater and freshwater that <br>
        occurs in estuary areas where rivers meet ocean water,<br>
        such as the Long Island Sound. As the bacteria tend to<br>
         grow more rapidly in warm water, the disease has <br>
         always been more common during the summertime.</p></div>
